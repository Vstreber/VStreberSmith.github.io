<h3 id="Death Seminar Start">Fall off a Cliff and Die: Hilarity of Death in Video Games</h3>

<!--To format this essay for HTML, I used this website: https://saasytrends.com/gdoc-to-html-->
<p>The pairing of death and enjoyment in video games, though perhaps counterintuitive on paper, has never been out of the ordinary. Video games are only the most recent addition to a long line of violence-and-death-centric media that treat such things with humor. Having grown up watching video games as much as I played them directly, I've consumed (and found comedy in) the ragdolling, the overwhelm of glitches, and the accidents that occur along the descent to death -- including the ones intended by the player. To me, these things were intuitively funny -- as they clearly were to content creators and other viewers. But, I never questioned our mutual understanding of hilarity as a strange indicator towards how we treat virtual death. How much of the comedic mindset towards death in video games is perpetuated by hard-wired mechanics, and how much is from our already established thoughts on death in other media -- thoughts that are echo-chambered within player communities? The virtual game body is not us; yet at the same time, player characters do have human minds piloting them. Given this, what exactly do players opt into when they laugh at virtual death?</p>
<p>The greater conversation of "ethical" depiction and consumption of violence, and its impact on the populace, will not be discussed in the scope of this paper -- that's already been explored in debates around video game violence since their genesis. Instead, I'm curious to better define the relationship between death and comedy in games. Though humor in games has been studied extensively, death as a component is often an afterthought, lumped in with violence as a simplified shock-factor conglomerate. It is a mechanic listed on the same level as dialogue, sound design, and player interactions when discussed alongside humor. Many have created their own anatomies of humor, all with their overlaps and applications; in this paper I intend to mimic this, by surveying the trope of comedic death and creating a step-by-step anatomy of the humorous video game death. I argue that video games work to caricaturize death in ways that media has always done, but also in fresh ways that are only allowed by video game's medium specificity. Humor is one of, if not <em>the</em>, most important methods through which the unique conception of video game death -- within a larger scheme of death -- is defined.</p>
<p>Though video games are an entirely unique mode of media, they are built upon years of media history and tropes. In order to examine where we are today with comedic death in games, it's necessary to see how we got here. The history of slapstick comedy in film and TV is foundational context in conversation with video game death comedy. In his article, "Uproarious Inventions", Rob King cites the Keystone Film Company as both the zeitgeist of the 1900's conception of humorous film, as well as a foundational cornerstone in what slapstick means to us today. There is, of course, a much broader history of slapstick development -- however, Keystone is an ideal historical example, and its specificity is helpful in comparison to games. The Keystone Film Company, created alongside such other feats of technical wonder and comedy like "the mechanical rides at Coney Island" or "the "invention' cartoons of Rube Goldberg", jumped onto this fresh early-1900s wave of fascination with "inventiveness'. The company's success came with developments in elaborate feats of mechanical stunts, "featuring the haywire tin lizzies, out of control police wagons, somersaulting planes, and other contraptions in which the studio's films abounded from the mid-1910s on." The Keystone Kops are one such example: in figure one, we see the Kops (a band of hilariously ineffective policemen who frequently find themselves in elaborately ridiculous situations) teetering of the edge of a cliff in a police car, typifying Keystone's fascination with mechanics humor that is <em>made up of</em> mechanical components -- in this case, an automobile. These stunts, especially those involving cars and explosions, took on like wildfire in the populace of film-goers -- the constructions of elaborate violence became a "carnivalesque reflection of a mechanized world."</p>

<p>With its extreme success, the Keystone Film Company's conception of mechanical wonder is often what we think of when we consider slapstick today, and also falls perfectly in line with both the restriction and the desires towards violence in media. People want to see a carnivalized version of violence; it is also very difficult to display violence and death on the screen, without the mechanics of these things made blatantly visually clear. As both a mass cultural object and also as one of the first to approach slapstick with both humor and thrill in mind, Keystone's brand of slapstick, though often deathless, approaches violence with wonder and a light heart, as well as with a close viewing eye -- very reminiscent of video games today.</p>
<p>Regardless of form or medium, whether it's animated Looney Toons or Charlie Chaplin-esque live action, the Keystone company established the core components of physical humor: mechanical wonder mixed with rapid movement, where the "very speed of the action forestalled adequate comprehension." For instance, in Keystone's lineage, Looney Tunes' Wile E. Coyote runs into a painted wall so quickly and with such confidence that he completely flattens, to be immediately followed by an anvil; in <em>City Lights</em>, Charlie Chaplin's character The Little Tramp is convinced to fight in a rigged boxing match and split the money, only for his opponent to be swapped out by a masterful fighter, and he is knocked out instantly; and many other examples can follow. This kind of rapid slapstick has become timeless: audiences in modern times are already used to -- and receptive of -- greater speeds often being equivalent to greater humor, as videos on social media become shorter and shorter, and as reaction times (especially in games) have increased due to practice and necessary skill obtainment. What used to be so fast that it "forestalled adequate comprehension" likely doesn't hold a candle to the speed at which younger generations of content consumers can take in information today -- and this only hyperbolizes the comedic qualities of high-paced action that Keystone kicked off, and the legacy of which video games continue.</p>
<p>This comedic quality of speed, as well as Keystone's "playground of stunts' mentality, are both things we absolutely see reflected in video games. Both are highly visual forms, and the thrill of stunts largely comes from detailed viewing; not just the ability to see the violence, but to see every detail of its mechanics. We can see this collision unfolding before us with a kind of morbid fascination. It is this "mechanical fascination" that makes slapstick -- and its evolved form in games -- so magnetic for viewers: we are drawn in by "the technical "how,' with virtuoso technique and technological achievement". In both slapstick films and humorous virtual death, you can get up close to an exploding car, you can watch a figure tumble off of a cliff and experience the virtual body's full impact off of the ground, and you can see the full destruction that an explosion might cause in the real world. Many games even pursue this realism past the screen with features such as buzzing haptics on the controller in response to an explosion, and our fascination with getting as close as possible to the virtual is further typified by the volume of fictional writing on the so-called "perfect" VR setup featuring a fully 4D experience. The franchises of <em>Ready Player 1 </em>and <em>The Matrix</em> are two prominent examples: in both, the virtual world is used to battle, commit violence, and witness and cause death with glee.</p>
<p>This "how to' rhetoric of slapstick, where we wish to see and understand the full detail of violence, is best seen in physics-based games, often those with a sandbox element where users can create their own courses of slapstick. These games are able to extend slapstick past its violence-centrism, by introducing the core topic of this paper: death. Take <em>Happy Wheels </em>(2010), for example: the player chooses from a roster of "inadequately prepared" characters (consisting of old men, a father on a bike with his child, etc) and tries to navigate them through a deadly, physics-based course. Make a misstep, and your unfortunate racer will lose limbs or shred to pieces in a bloody (albeit cartoonish) display. No matter how battered or bloodied your character, so long as you make it across the finish line, you win -- allowing the player to see the absolute depths of a body falling apart before they're able to fail. This is a game where both the buildup and fallout of slapstick is entirely up to the player, and is based around seeing the mechanics of death in full detail for comedy's sake. Further, the game has a lively player base which takes advantage of the game's custom level mode, in which you can create any sort of death course your heart desires. <em>Happy Wheels </em>solidified its popularity through both this element of user interaction, as well as through its potency in the content creation. Prominent YouTube creator Seán William McLoughlin (who goes by jacksepticeye online, stylized lowercase), made a series of over one hundred videos on the game, each garnering millions of views -- and his 22-hour compilation of all of these videos has 3.6 million views on its own.</p>

<p>It may be helpful to broaden the scope by looking at video game humor in general without death's specificity, or perhaps even humor as a whole. Scholars of humor have long tried to organize comedy into neat categories in an attempt to explain exactly why we find things humorous. There's the classical relief-superiority-incongruity theory, which argues that we laugh due to three modes of humor: a relief from built-up emotional tension, a sense of superiority over the subject of humor, and a sense of ridiculousness from incongruent events taking place -- think random- or surreal-based humor. There's also more detailed examinations, such as in Arthur Asa Berger's book <em>The Art of Comedy Writing</em>, which organizes all comedy writing into forty-five categories that are asserted to be all a humorist needs to generate humor -- "no fewer, no more."</p>
<p>Such structures are useful, but certainly not all-encompassing in their application, at least in the ways they were intended to be -- relief-superiority-incongruity is rather old in its original written-up applications, and Berger, though he cites a wide range of applications, does not consider these things in the digital age of video games and more interactive media. This does not render these structures useless for my examination, but rather shows that they need to be extended to apply to games. It follows that, because of video game's medium specificity, the same kind of organization has been applied to game humor. In Claire Dormann's extensive work in game humor studies, she developed a new trio of categories to help talk about forms of virtual comedy: "scripted humor (game-to-player) is contrasted with spontaneous humor (player-to-player) and emergent humor (player-to-game)." Utilizing Dormann's structures in tandem with relief-superiority-incongruity, we can at last break down the humorous video game death, piece by piece.</p>
<p>First, there is the lead-up to death. This can be as slow and methodical as setting up elaborate traps of death for other players, much like the mechanical setups of original slapstick or its Rube Goldberg inspirations -- we see this in games like the aforementioned <em>Happy Wheels </em>and other similar physics simulators. Or, it can be as snappy as switching dimensions in <em>Stonerid 2D, </em>which<em> </em>"can get avatars killed so unexpectedly that the players just cannot help themselves but laugh." These moments, of either extremely elaborate or extremely fast violence (or perhaps both) are humorous on their own -- while violence is most often the instigator of death in video games, virtual violence can also hold humor in its own right. However, the moment of death brings an incongruous break -- either in its stillness or in its lack of complexity -- that gives it much of its comedic potency. These built-up before-times of death are effective due to both their compliance with (and often desensitization of) the reality of death, as well as in their ability to span all three modes of game humor proposed by Dormann. Seeing a body knocked into space is more impactful than, say, an object, because the bodies (especially of the ragdoll type) "balance a desire for realism with a desire for entertainment." The image of death is still "the most effective mechanism," yet its intention in video games is usually anything but actual realism -- the image of a fast-moving body sparks some crossed wires in our mind. It's shocking, but it's not real -- we can therefore justify laughing, while the implications of the real shock are left unexplored.</p>
<p>What follows after the lead up is the break, snap, or otherwise instantaneous mechanic that simulates death for the player by doing a myriad of things: removing their ability to control, playing a specific sound, causing a cutscene of death to play, or any number of other indicators. Where films have struggled with the concept of preserving and depicting the moment of death, most games that use death as a mechanic are unconcerned with this. The aforementioned sound cue of death is an especially potent indicator for humor. Many well-circulated clips of humorous death end with this sound cut-off, akin to the genre of so-called perfectly cut screams -- the death cry or death noise of a game is the virtual death rattle. A very notable example of this is the infamous "You Died" screen, made iconic through FromSoftware's Dark Souls series -- the frequency of death due to the series' notorious difficulty has made the screen a kind of inside-joke to those who have mutually suffered, and found absurd humour in the sheer quantity of times they've died. The specific Dark Souls style of death screen features an ominous drone noise, as you witness your player-character maimed to death and as screen fades to black with red text, comedically stating the obvious: <em>You Died</em>. As seen in Fig. 3, this death screen has been meme-ified to oblivion, often paired with lunging pets or animals for comedic effect.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Finally, there is the aftermath of death, which is best encapsulated in Dormann's player-to-game category. This is because after death, the player has a few choices; post-death is often a stop-point for a game, a pause for the player to decide what to do next: <em>I'll either win or die, and then I'll stop playing for tonight</em>. This can especially be the case if you die fantastically; the adrenaline will either carry you forth, repeating your in-game experience once more, or be enough to stop playing for the night -- to end "on a good note.' It may also be a pause for discourse with secondary viewers, either virtual or in-person; a place to take in what just happened; a place to perhaps upload your death (many platforms feature a "clips" mechanism, which can be activated to record the past few seconds of gameplay even if you weren't actively recording). It is in this aftermath that we can find one of the cornerstones as to why video game death is so effective at humor: the player can orchestrate, witness, and fully experience death -- and can then choose to react or do whatever they please. Video game death's complete and total player adaptability is a powerful trait indeed.</p>
<p>In light of this anatomy, and returning to our historical slapstick example once more, one can easily draw a throughline from the mechanical fascination of the Keystone Company's 1900's audiences to the mechanical fascination of today. The fallout of something like a virtual explosion can carry on the mechanical fascination that slapstick started by <em>literally continuing</em> its motion in ways that reality could never, due to intentional tweaks in the game's physics system -- in such games, your player and/or nearby NPCs will go flying an incredible distance at mach speed. Take <em>Breath of the Wild</em> or <em>Lethal Company</em>, for example: both wildly popular games, and both featuring player use, abuse, and conflict with each game's exaggerated physics systems. Both games' internal physics engines are inflated to such an extent that gravity and weight don't apply like they would in reality, and the potential for ridiculously high speeds and intense collisions is upped immensely. Often, glitches in games will allow players to propel even past the already accentuated bounds of the virtual world, and can be accessed both intentionally and unintentionally, further reinforcing player agency to create humor for themselves. Because of this newfound physical freedom, we have evolved beyond the "how to' enjoyment of Keystone slapstick -- with games, we now have built a "what if' instinct instead, as players become the director, actor, and viewer of their own death-centric slapstick. And within this motion of slapstick continuity, we find death as the moment of pause, where we lose direct control and must watch, instead. We are given a moment for us to absorb what just happened, and laugh.</p>
<p>This is one logical explanation of death as humor in games -- to the players that laugh when they die, it's not really thought of as death, but rather as time in which to process the events that just unfolded:<em> What just happened?</em>  <em>How did I die so terribly (or, so terrifically)?</em> With this, it makes sense that death can be funny -- however, this doesn't seem all-encompassing. Though clearly not on par with a legitimate death in reality, virtual death features an arguably more impactive component than film death: when your character dies, you're the one impacted. There is a kind of reality to game death -- one's trajectory in the game is permanently altered by it in real time. Instead of being a recorded and/or scripted event preserved in time, death in games is in many ways closer to real death than any media depiction has ever been.</p>
<p>Further, virtual death features an instigator role that is also played by a real person -- many games center around the goal of killing others, whether they be NPCs or real players, and the process of instigating death can be a source of humor, too. This instigation is a perfect setup for the aforementioned "superiority" humor; perhaps you prank someone to die in <em>Minecraft</em>, or are able to sneak up on an oblivious enemy in <em>CS:GO</em> and kill them. In both, humor comes from your own competence in killing, and your victim's failure to survive. However, this specific mode of killing for humor has some implications which, at first glance, seem contradictory to humor. These implications are explored in Amanda Phillips' article "Shooting to Kill", in which the dynamics of video game death are examined through the lens of politics. She explores the torturous violence of video games in tandem with that of the real world, with the aim of developing a sense beyond the thus-far simplified narrative of video game death morality. Games, she asserts, can be understood as a "playground of mortality in which new orientations toward death and dying might be invented, rehearsed, and even normalized." -- and such a rehearsal has political implications. We can remember the equivalent "playground of stunts' from Keystone's slapstick; again, this desire for freely creating violence is not new. Phillips characterizes this marriage of death politics and the virtual world as a new term: mechropolitics, which examines how the death-world of video games uses death as a mechanic, a currency, and a source of power dynamics that both recreates and enforces those of the real world. She examines video game death alongside the real-world, American military torture-scandal of Abu Ghraib; we find things such as Abu Ghraib horrific "not because of the abuses per se but because of the gleefulness with which their perpetrators seemed to execute (and document) them." Video game deaths do not hold the same realism and gravity as those of Abu Ghraib (though game creators are certainly trying to increase their realism of violence with every release); but this doesn't matter as much as the ways players react to such deaths. And as we have seen, players react with glee, in both the execution and documentation of their enemies.</p>
<p>So, if virtual death means an extant form of bloodied hands for its administrator, and if the rhetoric of ""it's just a game' cannot always hold", how do we still render virtual death as funny? On the one hand, there's a gut-reflex answer: humor can be killed by overthinking, and therefore the humor of video game death doesn't allow its participants to consider the meaning of death. But I also think the answer is more complex than this, and centers around an important fact: death in video games is experienced by all. No one gets to only dish it out -- everyone loses at games, and that loss is very frequently just player death. This doesn't mean we should disregard Phillip's complications in video game death; rather, mechropolitics are not something that players actively ignore when they're laughing at death, but something they are actively participating in. It is precisely the politics of desensitization of death in games that allows them to be funny: there is a moral and humorous disconnect between "the pull between honoring the seriousness of death and the impulsion to play with and become its master" -- and it is this disconnect that allows for the specific brand of incongruity humor that video game death provides.</p>
<p>There is also the question of death's implications as a mechanic: more often than not, it's a setback in gameplay, one that's often frustrating and indicates some sort of failure on the part of the player. But, clearly this frustration isn't preventing enjoyment -- and the work of scholar Bo Ruberg helps to shed some light on why. In their article "Playing to Lose", Ruberg puts two separate pieces on failure together -- one on failure in video games, and the other in failing queerly -- and explores how there is pleasure to be found in failure of video games, and this pleasure is intrinsically linked with queer resistance to normative expectations. Ruberg asserts that the norm of winning, and of avoiding death, has never been the sole norm of enjoyment: "failure might be its own success, its own pleasure, its own art--performed not by the game but by the player."</p>
<p>While Ruberg's writing relates more to generalized pleasure, an important prerequisite to understanding why players not only take joy and humour out of failing by accident, but also in failing on purpose -- making the most ridiculous deaths possible for both their enemies and themselves, as a source of enjoyment to all. It is already strange that we can enjoy failure, so it easily follows that enjoying failure is equally queer, yet somehow still prolific in playerbases. Death is emotional, significant, and deeply estranged from the modern viewer in most ways other than immediate violence. It follows that it's queer to seek out humorous death, and it is simultaneously deeply human, too. There is a power in accepting death with laughter, a kind of mastery of something otherwise so dire. Finding humor in death is the same as finding enjoyment in failure: it is a "spectacular, masochistic mode of resistance that disassembles normative expectations in and out of the game world."</p>
<p>Games have, in many ways, embraced the limitations of death's depiction, whereas film will often try and fail to break these limitations. The slow reality of natural death, the stages of dying post a violent injury, and the lack of a true "moment of death" have all been grappled with when regarding depiction -- and many have come to the conclusion that the visual representation of death is not possible. Though taken from a documentarian's lens, the words of Vivian Sobchack ring true for most visual media: "death itself confounds and exceeds its indexical representation." Instead of bemoaning this limitation, however, games often embrace it. Though games certainly fall into the same tropes of media death such as the thrill of the instant kill and the lack of regard for the dying -- and such limitations should be examined in regards to how we treat death as a concept -- games, from their core construction, appear to be the most unfettered by the unrepresentability of death. That being said, the world of indie games is an ever-expanding one, and one which is constantly pushing on the bounds of what games can do. Perhaps the increased interactability of games will one day be proven to make the perfect medium to treat death more seriously, more realistically; with or without humor.</p>
